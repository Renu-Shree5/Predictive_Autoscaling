# Managing Infrastructure Scale through AI â€“ Auto scaling by Prediction Method
The Machine Learning model Predicts the next Resource Utilization of the process in IT industry.This project aims to utilize AI for dynamically estimating resource requirements. The goal is to automate the autoscaling process by analyzing various types of datasets.
# Key Datasets
1. Current System Resource Utilization:
This dataset captures the current state of resources being utilized on the system.
2. Instantaneous Process Resource Utilization:
This dataset records the resources used by the current process at a specific moment.
3. Session-wise Process Resource Utilization:
This dataset tracks the resources used by the current process throughout its entire session.
# Procedures
# Data Collection
Gathered data on current system resource utilization.
Collected data on the resources utilized by processes at specific instances.
Accumulated data on the resources used by processes throughout their sessions.
# Data Analysis
Analyzed the collected datasets to identify patterns and trends in resource usage.
Employed AI models to predict future resource requirements based on the analyzed data.
# Autoscaling
Implemented an autoscaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on predictions from the AI models.
Ensured the system efficiently uses resources and can handle varying loads without manual intervention.

By integrating these procedures, the project successfully created a robust solution for dynamic resource estimation and autoscaling, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.
